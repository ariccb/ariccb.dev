## Personal Achievments On This Project

- Used principles of design to plan and design interfaces ahead of development, collaborating effectively with teammates to move from **ideas > strategy > prototypes > final product.**
- Iterated on code base quickly, refactoring code dynamically on **front-end and back-end** in tandem due to project direction changes, layout updates, and feature changes, and developed complex **Dynamic Reference** Mongoose.js schemas to allow simple user sign up regardless of user type.
- A user-focused approach was used to design the essential features of the app. **User testing** was used to validate our ideas, and test the effectiveness of our implementations.
- Developed features efficiently by first writing **vertically sliced user stories,** then designing the UI, component framework, front-end state management logic, and creating server-side endpoints to support the required functionality.
- Architected the application to be **asynchronous,** and maintained strict **separation of concerns** between the functional parts of the application.
- Wrote **automated tests,** designed complex front-end React components, and connected them to the server endpoints.

## Plans For Future Features

- Integrate the **OpenAI generative AI API** to process user input, helping them brainstorm and flesh out their ideas. Utilize AI to generate unique profile images based on user profiles, adding an **element of fun** for students.
