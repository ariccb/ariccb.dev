## Full-Stack Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web applications**,
- **Dashboard layouts**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- and anything I can make more beautiful and fun.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

## AI & Agent Workflows

<VStack spacing={12}>
  <Callout variant='react'>
    AI pairing is baked into how I ship: I craft prompts and context pipelines that keep velocity high while protecting architecture, quality, and UX.
  </Callout>

  <Callout variant='tailwind'>
    <strong>Daily tools</strong>
    <HStack spacing={8}>
      <Label indicator={100}>GitHub Copilot</Label>
      <Label indicator={100}>ChatGPT (Codex)</Label>
      <Label indicator={100}>Claude Code</Label>
      <Label indicator={100}>Cursor</Label>
      <Label indicator={100}>Repo Prompt</Label>
      <Label indicator={100}>Augment Code</Label>
    </HStack>
  </Callout>

  <Callout variant='material-ui'>
    <strong>Patterns I use</strong>
    - Code generation + refactor loops paired with unit/visual tests
    - Context packs that combine code search, domain models, and design docs
    - Agent reviews for API contracts, performance, accessibility, and docs
    - Custom prompt chains for feature planning and migration playbooks
  </Callout>
</VStack>

## Favourite Technologies Right Now

<Callout variant='js'>
TypeScript is my default for full-stack work. I design type-safe APIs, domain models, and UI contracts so features stay reliable from database to browser.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='react'>
Next.js (App Router) with React 18 is my primary web stack. I ship production-ready dashboards, multi-tenant role-based access, and real-time collaboration with confident routing, caching, and SSR/ISR patterns.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='tailwind'>
Favorite UI system: Tailwind CSS paired with shadcn/ui and Radix primitives, orchestrated with TanStack Query for server state and caching. This stack lets me move quickly while still delivering polished, accessible UIs.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='material-ui'>
Material UI remains a great fit for enterprise surfaces—I customize tokens and theming so it feels bespoke, and I'm equally comfortable with Chakra UI and other component frameworks.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='framer-motion-rive'>
Framer Motion is my go-to for purposeful motion design—page choreography, micro-interactions, and responsive states that make the UI feel intentional.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='framer-motion-rive'>
Rive adds interactive, state-machine-driven vector animations when I want hero moments, empty states, or playful feedback without compromising performance.
</Callout>

## Story Of My Coding Journey

I started my career as a software developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years ago**.
I was working as a drafting technologist and was first introduced via a visual programming tool - namely **Dynamo for Revit** by AutoDesk.

Soon I realized that I couldn't rely on other people's pre-built nodes to get what I needed, as they had a tendency to stop working when their dependencies were updated.

That's when my journey of self-taught software development began, and I did some research to find the easiest path to developing add-ins, and I decided to learn **PyRevit** (which utilizes **IronPython** to interface with **.NET**) as a way build add-ins for our company.

I then took up a mentor to because I wanted to learn how to develop applications on the web. He introduced me to **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, using the **Vue.js** framework. **Vuetify** was the UI Component Framework I used to develop my first personal projects.

### First Personal Projects

- **A chat web application** - for learning the ins and outs of express.js api endpoints, server calls, and building the app so different users can interact with each other.
- **Go board game** - used to learn high-level object oriented programming concepts, classes, inheritance, etc.
- **A Spotify Music Taste Sampler App** - to learn how to access REST APIs and learn how to make database queries and manipulate the data. This was my first introduction to **MongoDB** and **Mongoose.js**

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and how to make my layouts and designs _intuitive_ and _professional_.

### Recreating Vintage Video Games To Learn **C#**

After developing some initial add-ins on the **PyRevit** third-party plugin, I wanted to learn to develop native add-ins for **Revit**, and I needed to learn C# in order to do that.
To aid in learning the syntax and structure C# needed, my mentor used several old-school video games to learn the concepts.

- **Pong** - to learn event listeners, basic AI/ dynamically moving parts, rendering, etc.
- **Space Invaders** - more advanced practice with event listeners, classes, inheritance.
- **Donkey Kong** - to learn serialization, deserialization, and how to build a utility application alongside, like a level editor.
